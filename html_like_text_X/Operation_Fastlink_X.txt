Operation FastLink is a coordination of four separate, simultaneous undercover investigations by the FBI, the FBI Cyber Division, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Computer Crimes and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) of the Criminal Division and Interpol. The four different investigations have not been publicly enumerated, but the U.S. Department of Justice has said in at least one press release that "Operation Higher Education" is the largest component, with participation from twelve nations. Mention has also been made of an investigation into pre-release music groups led by FBI agents from the Washington Field Office. As of March 6, 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation states that Operation FastLink has yielded 60 convictions. The raids occurred in similar fashion to those from Operation Buccaneer and Operation Site Down. Other somewhat-related law enforcement actions include Operation Gridlock and Operation D-Elite.
The operation led to the successful busts of nearly 100 individuals involved in illegal copying of copyrighted software (i.e. "software piracy"), and alterations thereof, worldwide. There were around 120 total searches executed in 27 state and in 10 foreign countries. Foreign searches were conducted in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, the Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden as well as Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Among the prolific warez release groups targeted by Fastlink were Fairlight, Kalisto, Echelon, Class, and DEViANCE—all of which specialized in spreading unlicensed copies of computer and console video games. Recent convictions have included members of music release groups Apocalypse Production Crew and Chromance.
