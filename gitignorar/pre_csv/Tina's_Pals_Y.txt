<p><i><b>Tina's Pals</b></i> ("Turma da Tina") is a Brazilian comic strip series, part of the <a href="/wiki/Monica%27s_Gang" title="Monica's Gang">Monica's Gang</a> series, created in 1970. The stories are aimed at a more teenage group of readers, rather than the kids who would read other <a href="/wiki/Mauricio_de_Sousa" title="Mauricio de Sousa">Mauricio de Sousa</a>'s works and thus center around teenagers. However, Mauricio prefers not to mention drugs, sex, alcoholic drinks, or other similar subjects, which are very popular among teenagers. Instead, the strips are written with themes related to school or university, dating, problems with parents, etc.
</p><p>Originally the stories recounted the life of Tina and her family living in <a href="/wiki/Salvador,_Bahia" title="Salvador, Bahia">Salvador</a>, Flip (Toneco) was the original protagonist.

<p>During the year of 1970, during the debut of <a href="/wiki/Monica_(Monica%27s_Gang)" title="Monica (Monica's Gang)">Monica</a>'s first comic book series Mauricio de Sousa decided to create a new comic strip series to replace the absence of his characters in the newspapers. In that same year several new characters were created, however the only characters that were kept were the boy <i>Flip</i> along their siblings <i>Toim</i> and <i>Tina</i> (that was a hippie kid in the first stories), his father and grandma, that later had their comics published also in the <i>Monica'</i>s comic book starting at the 6th issue.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> After a few years Mauricio de Sousa began to be more interested in creating stories involving Tina, and later created their friends <i>Curly</i> (which was also another hippie character) and <i>Puff</i> in 1972, and the comics with Flip together family were becoming less frequent until get absent in the later comics.
</p><p>At the end of the '70s the comics had gigantic changes in the art style and personalities of the characters: Tina and her friends become teenagers and have abandoned the hippie culture, Tina started to be drawn with more realistic and feminine features, and after the 80's appeared new characters like Puff's boyfriend: <i>Steve</i> (who eventually became a main character after a few years) and several other one-time characters. Since the '80s the comics have become one of the most popular franchises created by Mauricio de Sousa, continuing to have more modern stories and solding special titles and miniseries over the years.
