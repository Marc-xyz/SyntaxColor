<p><b>Tassan Rovers GAA</b> (<a href="/wiki/Irish_language" title="Irish language">Irish</a>: <i lang="ga">CLG An tEasán</i>) was a <a href="/wiki/Gaelic_football" title="Gaelic football">Gaelic football</a> team in <a href="/wiki/Tassan" title="Tassan">Tassan</a>, <a href="/wiki/County_Monaghan" title="County Monaghan">County Monaghan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. Ireland was emerging from the great economic depression of the 1930s and the civil war which had  divided families and communities in many parts of the country. Times were tough for small farm enterprises with young family members emigrating to try to find work abroad to support themselves and their families at home in Ireland. It was in this context that the Tassan team came together in early 1937 and participated in the Junior League Mid Monaghan section. The team was managed by Francis Brennan, John Mulligan, Peter Flanagan and Frank Murphy. Paddy Morgan, Lisdrumgormely was also associated with the team.
The Tassan team wore red jerseys and trained and played football in a local meadow field known as the "Boggan" owned by Peter Flanagan and located up the Tassan road from Tommy Conlan's cottage and across the road from Owenie Morgan's house.

<p>The first reported game and victory against <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ballybay_Pearse_Brothers_GFC" title="Ballybay Pearse Brothers GFC">Ballybay Pearse Brothers</a> was reported in the <i>Northern Standard</i> on Friday 26 March 1937:
</p><p>"Ballybay Juniors travelled over to Tassan, near the Armagh Border on Sunday evening last where they suffered a big defeat in a League fixture. The visitors opened well and starting off at a brisk pace opened the score from a penalty taken by Finnegan, and Wynne tipped over a point. Ballybay's big following sent their hats in the air over this sweeping bit of play. Tassan soon settled down, Maguire sending in a rasping shot that found the net. Several rushes by the home side were successfully warded off by Duffy and Dowd on the defence line and Ballybay was leading by a point at half time. On the change over Mulligan leveled the score and Wynne was again in the limelight for Pearse Bros. Excitement ran high when he put the town lads leading by a goal. Tassan's turn came when their sure shot Maguire drew even. Up to this the contest was an equal battle, but towards the close Tassan took over control and kept scoring at regular intervals. Final result Tassan 4 goals 5 points ; Ballybay 2 goals 2 points. The forward line from the town was a weak combination that needs overhauling. The defence was praiseworthy, but it was impossible to hold those hefty gaels from the border. Mr. P. Duffy was an impartial referee." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

<p>The return game with Ballybay was recorded in the Northern Standard on 9 April 1937:
</p><p>"Sunday last saw a great turnout of people to the Athletic grounds where the County Board had arranged a double fixture. The opening Junior tie was between Tassan and Ballybay. The town team playing with the wind were slow to settle down. For the first 15 minutes the exchanges were kept in mid-field, then John Wynne that clever forward, moved up and scored the first point. After this there was good tackling and the contest grew livelier. Several onsloughts by Tassan tested the Ballybay backs and the second score came to Tassan when in a melee round the Ballybay goals, Mc Elroy tipped over. The visitors kept pressing and added two further minors and the score at half time was Tassan 3 points ; Ballybay 1 point. On the change over Ballybay got away, their forwards, Wynne, M. West and Linden, in good hand passing, netted a goal per West. On the kick out Leo Kearney rushed into the net from about 20 yards out. Tassan then pointed per F. Mulligan (2), Mc Elroy (2), and the full time result read: Ballybay Pearse Bros. 2 goals, 1 point; Tassan 7 points. Mr. Flanagan was an impartial referee." <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

</p><p>"Latton juniors made a rather poor display in their opening game of the season at home on Sunday against Tassan. They need a lot of training on the nice points of the game. Tassan, a new team, are a well selected team of promising youths, who bid fair to shed lustre on central Clontibret this season. Latton made a brilliant opening and were first to goal per Carragher, who with Mc Guinness and Mc Cabe made a strong trio. Wm Mc Caughey from a rasping shot replied for Tassan. When the visitors spread out they took possession, Maguire pointing and Mc Mahon goaling, put the issue beyond the region of doubt. Several tries by Latton saw the forwards finish weakly and the Clontibret team won easily on the score: - Tassan 3 goals, 2 points ; Latton 1 goal. Mr. Sweeney made an admirable referee.

Britain and France then declared war on Germany after Hitler had refused to abort the invasion. Ireland which was neutral depended on supplies of coal and fuel from Britain. The main industry in Ireland was agriculture, many small farms in <a href="/wiki/Tassan" title="Tassan">Tassan</a> produced flax, potatoes, corn, vegetables and had an abundance of bog which provided fuel to neighboring areas. The closeness of the border with <a href="/wiki/Armagh" title="Armagh">Armagh</a> also provided an opportunity to make an income from smuggling goods and supplies which were scarce on either side, this was always risky but the challenge of evading the Customs and making a few bob was attractive and fostered a sense of close community spirit and resilience during difficult times. The outbreak of war disrupted the fixture list for football games, rationing of fuel made it difficult for players to get to games, scarcity of the day to day items lead to rationing of tea, sugar and other goods, the reporting on games was also impacted by a shortage of paper. Ireland remained neutral during the war and a state of emergency was declared  in 1939, which included censorship of the press and correspondence. The local paper focused on events in Europe and on National issues with little emphasis being placed on sporting activities.

</p><p>Report on the 1939 Dr. Ward Cup Final drawn game held between Tassan and Killanny in Castleblayney on Sunday 7 April 1940. "It was probably due to the Second World War and the restriction censorship requirement for secrecy, that the names of players were omitted from the Northern Standard reports of the Dr. Ward Cup final."
</p><p>"Killanny and Tassan played a drawn game in the Junior Ward Cup final at Castleblayney on Sunday. It was a thrilling game; Killanny having much the better of the play in the first half. Both teams, however, played good football, Tassan in the second half showing up well, and a draw was a fitting result. Killanny had the advantage of a strong breeze in the first half, and after a few minutes play had two points to their credit. The tackling was keen but clean and Killanny would have had many scores but for good and keen play on the part of Tassan fulls. Killanny succeeded in scoring a goal just before the half time whistle, but Tassan who had many chances failed to register a score. With the advantage of the breeze in the second half Tassan attacked strongly and after ten minutes play raised the white flag and followed this up with a further minor. Killanny were not to be denied and worked back to the other end where they sent over for a point to again take the lead. Tassan now fought keenly and missed several easy chances of scoring. Maintaining the attack, Tassan stormed the sticks but after been beaten off several times they returned to score the equalizer just before the final whistle went; leaving score ;- KILLANNY, 1-3; TASSAN, 1-3. It was a well contested game and the re-play will be eagerly looked forward to. Mr. Duffy, Ballybay , refereed."

</p><p>The 1939 Dr. Ward Cup Final re-play between Tassan and Killanny was held in Castleblayney on Sunday 21 April 1940.
</p><p>"<b>TASSAN’S  TRIUMPH</b>" "There were two finals played in Castleblayney on Sunday – the re-play of the Dr. Ward Cup and the Minor final. The latter game between Inniskeen and Castleblayney preceded the cup final. Blayney won the minor final by five points. Towards the end of the Minor game rain commenced to fall, and continued heavily throughout the cup game. It proved to be a great game not withstanding the heavy rain, and although most of the spectators were drenched to the skin they remained on the side line to the end. Only a fortnight previously the teams treated the spectators, at the same venue, to a thrilling game which ended in a draw. The replay was eagerly looked forward to, and once again the spectators were treated to a great game, marred only by the rain and slippery pitch. Killanny won the toss and had the advantage of a slight breeze. Both teams were playing well having regard to the conditions and the ball was flicked from end to end at a very fast pace. The Tassan back line was exceptionally good, and many attempts on the Killanny forwards to get through failed. After a spirited attack Tassan sent through for goal and then followed a point. Killanny worked down and had two points from close frees. Then followed splendid play in kicking, passing and catching. The tackling was keen but clean, and on the whole the football was of a high standard. There were no further scores in this half . Half time score;- TASSAN 1 GOAL, 1 POINT ; KILLANNY 2 POINTS.
</p><p>On resumption Killanny attacked vigorously, and the Tassan goalie brought off a great save. Tassan were next attacking but a wide resulted. Up and down play followed for a considerable time, and it was surprising the high standard of football served up having regard to the conditions prevailing. Time and again Tassan back line held up the Killanny onslaughts, and returned the ball to the other end. Back came Killanny but still they could not get through and as the ball each time was flicked out of the Tassan goal mouth loud applause was heard from the Tassan supporters. Time was now running short, and Tassan put the game beyond all doubt by sending through a rasper to the net. Killanny were not discouraged, and in a lightning raid looked like  getting through but the Tassan goalie brought off a great save. Renewing the attack Killanny had a point just before the final whistle went, leaving the score; <b>TASSAN 2 GOALS, 1 POINT ; KILLANNY 3 POINTS.</b> Mr. T Bradley, Castleblayney refereed both games.
</p><p>Following the Tassan team's victory over Killanny there were great celebrations locally in Tassan when bonfires were lit at road junctions and the victory was celebrated in Peter Flanagan's barn. A victory dance was arranged for St. Mary's hall where there was a large attendance of support from all areas of the parish. The Dr. Ward Cup final triumph by Tassan was the pinnacle of the teams success and instilled a sense of pride and achievement locally during the dark years of World War II.

<p>The Second World War had a major impact on the teams progress, Local Defence Force (LDF) groups were established to defend the country in the event of an invasion by the Germans. The scarcity of resources and rationing had taken its tole on the community and by 1943 the Tassan Rovers team was no longer functioning. With the ending of the war in 1945 the Clontibret O’ Neills team was re- formed.

<p>As the Tassan team had not received their medals for their success in winning the 1939 Ward Cup Final against Killanny on Sunday 21 April 1940, in Castleblayney a decision was taken in early 1977, that a reunion of the team should be organised almost 37 years later to acknowledge the achievement and present the winning medals. The Northern Standard of Friday 14 January 1977 showed the picture of the Tassan team at its formation in 1937 with names as follows Back: (Left to Right:):"Wee" Peter Brennan (boy), Peter Flanagan, James Carroll (waist coat), Owen Conlan, William Mc Cahey (Headband), Dinny Brennan, Francis Brennan (shadow and hat), Eddie Sweeney, Frank Murphy, Packie Brennan, Paddy Mc Nally, Seamus Clerkin.

The function will be held at a date after the Ulster Convention in Enniskillen on March 5th. The new president of the Ulster Council will then be Con Shortt, N.T., who played on the Tassan team in 1939 and he will present the medals to the survivors of the 1939 outfit in the Braeside Ballroom."

</p><p>Northern Standard extract Friday May 6, 1977. "PRESENTATIONS  GALORE  AT  TASSAN  RE-UNION"
</p><p>It was presentations galore in the Braeside Ballroom, Clontibret, on Thursday night last when members of the Tassan Team which won the Dr Ward Cup in 1939 were at last presented with their medals by Monaghan County Board G.A.A.

In the 1939 final Tassan defeated Killanny and present at the function on behalf of the Killanny club were Mr. and Mrs. Patrick Dooley and Mr. and Mrs. Frank Thornton who were warmly welcomed by the MC. Mr. Fitzpatrick also thanked Mr. and Mrs. Mc Nally and staff of the Braeside, the Lisnagrieve Pipe Band; Mr. George Wallace and his catering staff; also the True Tones.

<p>Mr. Shortt thanked all the organisers of the function and said that when he first heard of it he couldn't believe that so many years had gone by. The Tassan team had been a continuation of the Clontibret team which had gone temporarily gone out of existence in 1936 and Tassan had come to the scene in 1937. He would like to put on record his pleasant memories of Tassan. They were a great team, had scored some splendid victories even one over Donaghmoyne who were then going great guns. He was sorry to see them going out in 1942 but then came the upsurge of the great Clontibret O’ Neills. He was very proud and honoured to be a member of the Tassan team and as somebody had said to him at the Annual Convention of the Ulster Council, "If we had P.R.O.s like Turlough Murray, Brendan Smyth and Eamonn Fitzpatrick, the G.A.A. would be known all over the world". When some of his pupils read about the re-union they said to him "those men must be getting on in years". He was delighted to again meet the victorious captain, Frankie Mullen, and all his old colleagues.

<p>Mr. Fitzpatrick added a touch of humour to the pleasant proceedings when he stated that the captain of the 1939 team, Frankie Mullen, "has the most unusual distinction of playing in 15 finals with 15 different teams but he has never got a medal until tonight"!
Mr. Mullen thanked Monaghan Co. Board and all responsible for "getting our medals at the end of our days".
Mr. Fitzpatrick said that if anyone had been left out they would only be too glad to present them with medals or plaques.

<p>The following letter was received from the ex-Secretary, Mr. Brian Brennan:
</p><p>"Dear Friends,
</p><p>It is with regrets that I express my disappointment of my inability to attend the Re-union and presentation social of medals to the members of the former Tassan football team but I would like to take this opportunity of wishing the former members of the team and committee every success on this nostalgic Re-union. My thanks to members who sought and acquired these medals after all these years and I feel sure the ex-players of the team will value them highly after such a long wait. My gratitude to Mr. Fitzpatrick for inviting me personally and Mr. Murray for his nice letter which I received this morning. My sympathy goes out to the families of the bereaved members of the club.
</p><p>In conclusion, I hope to be able to attend the special function for the former Tassan players and officials at a later date.
</p><p>Every success once again on your Re-union.
</p><p>Yours in spirit, Brian Brennan. (ex-Secretary)"
</p><p>It was reported by locals who attended the function on  28 April 1977, that one of the members of the team suggested that they be carried head height on the shoulders of supporters around the Braeside function room in celebration of the Teams success in finally getting their long over due medals. However, as the locals considered their own health and safety, given that the players had put on some weight over the intervening 37 years since the success, it was considered wise not to attempt to parade the players on the night.
There are many stories of the Tassan Team and their exploits which have faded in to history. Con Shortt, who was president of the Ulster Council, played county football for Armagh and Monaghan; he introduced the deletion of the 'Ban on Foreign Games' at the annual GAA conference in Queens University Belfast in 1971. Before 1971, the G.A.A. had a ban on its members playing or attending commonly called "foreign games", including soccer, rugby and hockey. This was known as ‘the exclusion rule’ or simply ‘The Ban’. The removal of the ban on foreign games provided an opportunity for all members of the community particularly in Northern Ireland to participate in G.A.A. games and attend other sports without being reprimanded or suspended. The Tassan team may have left the stage, but memories of the players and their achievements almost 80 years ago during World War II will always be remembered.
