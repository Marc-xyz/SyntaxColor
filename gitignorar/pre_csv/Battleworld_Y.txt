<p>Merged from dozens of fragments taken from many <a href="/wiki/Planet" title="Planet">planets</a> (including a suburb of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Denver,_Colorado" title="Denver, Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a> from <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>) by the <a href="/wiki/Beyonder" title="Beyonder">Beyonder</a>, Battleworld was designed to provide an unfamiliar environment which nevertheless allowed all contestants to use their powers to the fullest. Many peoples, both alien and human, were brought along "for the ride" by this method - it was because of this that <a href="/wiki/Julia_Carpenter" title="Julia Carpenter">Spider-Woman</a> II was on Battleworld, as was Zsaji, the healer, who had brief romances with both the <a href="/wiki/Human_Torch" title="Human Torch">Human Torch</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Four" title="Fantastic Four">Fantastic Four</a> and <a href="/wiki/Colossus_(comics)" title="Colossus (comics)">Colossus</a> of the <a href="/wiki/X-Men" title="X-Men">X-Men</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the aftermath of <a href="/wiki/Secret_Wars" title="Secret Wars">Secret Wars</a>, the planet became infected with cosmic energy as a result of the Beyonder reclaiming his stolen power from <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Doom" title="Doctor Doom">Doctor Doom</a>.

This is possibly either due to the Beyonder's nature as an incomplete <a href="/wiki/Cosmic_Cube" title="Cosmic Cube">Cosmic Cube</a>, which allows the wielder to alter reality around them by force of will, or was an aspect of the "heart's desire" promised by the Beyonders and granted to the default winners of the Secret Wars. All the heroes left the planet, except for <a href="/wiki/Thing_(comics)" title="Thing (comics)">Ben Grimm</a> (who stayed behind because he was able to change to and from his human form while on the planet's surface).

<p>A third Battleworld appeared in the 2015 <i><a href="/wiki/Secret_Wars_(2015_comic_book)" title="Secret Wars (2015 comic book)">Secret Wars</a></i> storyline, after the numerous incursions destroyed the <a href="/wiki/Multiverse_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Multiverse (Marvel Comics)">Multiverse</a>. The remains of several realities were all merged to form a new Battleworld with the planet having a roundish shape. All of these realities are known as domains which are ruled by an appointed "<a href="/wiki/Baron" title="Baron">Baron</a>" or a "Baroness", and while most domains have the ability to interact with each other, the borders of each domain are clearly defined and travel between different domains is discouraged, as it requires special dispensation from the local Baron or from Doom himself. Only the Deadlands (which contains the <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Zombies" title="Marvel Zombies">Marvel Zombies</a>), Perfection (which contains the <a href="/wiki/Ultron" title="Ultron">Ultron</a> Sentinels), and New Xandar (which contains the <a href="/wiki/Annihilation_(comics)" title="Annihilation (comics)">Annihilation Wave</a>) are separated from the rest by the Shield (a giant version of <a href="/wiki/Thing_(comics)" title="Thing (comics)">Ben Grimm</a>) because each contains threats that if loosed would destroy the other domains. This new Battleworld was created by its ruler <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Doom" title="Doctor Doom">Doctor Doom</a> (who is worshipped as its deity God Emperor Doom) after he and <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Strange" title="Doctor Strange">Doctor Strange</a> went to the <a href="/wiki/Beyonders" title="Beyonders">Beyonders</a> to stop the incursion of their reality. Although Doctor Strange didn't kill the Beyonders during the confrontation, Doctor Doom appears to do so by using a secret weapon, actually thousands of <a href="/wiki/Molecule_Man" title="Molecule Man">Molecule Man</a>, that allowed Doom to take the Beyonders' power as his own and incorporated the remnants of the realities destroyed by the incursions, or more precisely, their incursions points, to create his own image of Battleworld with Strange unable to do anything else but to follow his words.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>Battleworld is enforced by the Thor Corps who serve as Battleworld's police force who answer to God Emperor Doom.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Battleworld is <a href="/wiki/Geocentric_model" title="Geocentric model">orbited</a> by a small <a href="/wiki/Sun" title="Sun">Sun</a>, in fact the <a href="/wiki/Human_Torch" title="Human Torch">Human Torch</a>, consigned to the role for acting against Doctor Doom,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Knowhere" title="Knowhere">Knowhere</a>, that acts as Battleworld's <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">moon</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Besides these two and Battleworld itself, there were originally no more celestial bodies in its universe, until Singularity, a mysterious young girl who actually represents a pocket universe that gained sentience during the multiversal collapse, appears to give her life to save the citizens of Arcadia from a horde of Zombies which made the stars appear in the sky.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p>This Battleworld would eventually collapse<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> after God Emperor Doom's Beyonders' power was transferred to Reed Richards, who was considered by Doom himself and Molecule Man to be more worthy, and rectified the artificial reality.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p><p>As part of the <i><a href="/wiki/All-New,_All-Different_Marvel" title="All-New, All-Different Marvel">All-New, All-Different Marvel</a></i> event, it's revealed that the reality where Battleworld was fashioned was identified as <a href="/wiki/Secret_Wars_(2015_comic_book)" title="Secret Wars (2015 comic book)">Earth-15513</a> and became a distorted portion of time and space after the destruction of the planet, however due to Battleworld's reality having being the epicenter of this Multiversal renewal, it became rich in a substance known as Iso-8, a material identified as the byproduct of creation itself. When the Elders of the Universe of the restored Earth-616 realized that the Multiverse had endured a death and a rebirth, the <a href="/wiki/Collector_(comics)" title="Collector (comics)">Collector</a> and <a href="/wiki/Grandmaster_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)">Grandmaster</a> discovered the remnants of Battleworld and resolved to fight for the possession of the Iso-8 and used the broken shell as the arena (known as Battlerealm) for their Contest of Champions, a competition where several individuals, taken from Battleworld and the reborn Multiverse, fought to the death on behalf of each Elder. The highest prize was the Iso-Sphere which contained within the Power Primordial, the concentrated and most powerful form of the Iso-8.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> After assuming control of the Power Primordial that the Grandmaster and Collector were competing for, the Battleworld version of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maestro_(comics)" title="Maestro (comics)">Maestro</a> recreates Battleworld to its previous form as he had previously vowed that he would become the God-King of Battleworld.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> In order to combat the remaining players, Maestro summoned the remnants of the Avengers and Thunderbolts from an alternate reality where Iron Man became <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> after winning the <a href="/wiki/Civil_War_(comics)" title="Civil War (comics)">superhuman civil war</a> as well as summoning Sentry of Earth-1611 in order to deal with the remaining Contest of Champions competitors.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-15">[15]</a></sup> When the Iso-Sphere was stolen from Maestro by Outlaw, he used its power to banish Maestro away from Battleworld and teleport the contestants to wherever they wanted to be. As a consequence of Outlaw wishing that the Contest of Champions to end, the Iso-Sphere shattered. A group of the contestants decided to remain in Battleworld forming the Civil Warriors in order to guard the Iso-8 and the shards of the Iso-Sphere so they wouldn't fall into the wrong hands.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_15-1"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-15">[15]</a></sup>
