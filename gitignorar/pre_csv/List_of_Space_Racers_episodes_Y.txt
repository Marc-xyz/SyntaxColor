<p><b>Where Are We?:</b> Eager to emulate their favorite television hero, Captain Cosmos, cadets Eagle, Robyn and Hawk zoom off into space – only to encounter powerful solar flares that hurtle them down onto the surface of an unfamiliar planet. Stranded there until space conditions clear up, they must use their keenest observational and analytic skills to try and determine the composition of the soil and rocks, weather conditions and various other factors, hoping to figure out where they are in the Solar System and how to get back home... only to discover, in the end, that they’ve been back on Earth the entire time.

<b>Starling, D.S.V.:</b> Sandpiper is returning from an outer space mission when her rockets fail upon re-entry, and she splashes into the ocean and sinks. The teachers and students try to plan a rescue mission, but all are too big for Coot’s smaller scale prototype of a new deep space rescue sub – all except for Starling! The brave junior cadet submerges into the deep sea to trace Sandpiper’s path way down to the ocean floor. But with Sandpiper’s rockets disabled, Starling must somehow find a way to rescue her. Will she be able to use her observational skills – and maybe some discarded rocket boosters – to build an evacuation sled to bring Sandpiper to safety?</td></tr>

<p><b>Total Eclipse:</b> With the first solar eclipse in 26 years looming, Stardust Space Academy is preparing for the “Eclipse Run,” a tradition wherein two random students are chosen to race to the Moon and back during the eclipse. As the big day draws near, two Racers are picked: Eagle and… little Starling?!! Eagle is both amused and aghast at the lack of competition. But Starling is determined to compete, so she engages Robyn to tutor her. Thinking the race will be a piece of cake, Eagle lets his guard down and begins to slack off… until the solar eclipse strikes, plunging the race into darkness – an event that overconfident Eagle did not bother to prepare for.

<hr/>
<b>Fly Like an Eagle:</b> A deep space probe, designed to collect data in far off galaxies, prematurely reappears in our Solar System… on a collision course with the Sun. Headmaster Crane knows if it gets too close to the Sun’s gravity, the probe and all its collected research will be lost forever, so he assigns Eagle, Robyn and Hawk to intercept it and guide it safely back to Earth. The problem is, Eagle has a faulty heat shield that must be repaired, so at the 11th hour he’s scrubbed from the mission – leaving Hawk and Robyn to take off without their usual leader. How will they save the day without Eagle’s help?</td></tr>

<p><b>Star Signs:</b> While everyone in school learns about our Solar System’s many constellations, and how to identify them by their unique shapes, Eagle is resistant. Studying is tedious; he’s got “a need for speed!” As always, Eagle would much rather be out soaring through space, exploring, seeing new things and going new places! But when a fellow cadet named Crow is missing, Eagle, Robyn and Hawk are tasked with trying to find him. Their main clue: a cryptic radio message from Crow in which he talked about “following Swan.” Who is this mysterious Swan, and where was he leading the missing Space Racer to? Our three sleuths must learn to ask the right questions if they ever hope to find him.

<b>Vulture's Volcano:</b> Eagle, Robyn, Hawk and Raven are tasked by Headmaster Crane to learn more about planet Earth by studying an extinct volcano. The cadets are split into two teams: Hawk and Raven are the recon team assigned to a flyover and observation of a dormant volcano island, while Robyn and Eagle will man the mission center and analyze the observations and data transmitted. During their inspection, Hawk and Raven discover a secret operation run by Vulture and Dodo inside the volcano – to mine rocket fuel! The data coming in, however, shows that the volcano is no longer dormant… and it begins to erupt, trapping Vulture and Dodo. Will Robyn and Eagle be able to guide Crane and the Racers to the rescue of the greedy fuel makers?</td></tr>

<p><b>Mars Canyon Race:</b> It’s time for a Stardust Space Academy tradition: the exciting annual race across Mars’s rocky canyons, which happens once every Martian year (twice as long as an Earth year). Coach Pigeon is busy training and preparing the cadets, who aspire to be as good as the legendary all-time Mars Canyon Race champion, Swift Starlight. The race will span some difficult terrain that the cadets have not explored before: Valles Marineris, the red planet’s grandest canyon of all. Eagle and Raven get into some serious boasting and taunting, each confident that he’ll handily beat the other… which leads to a dare: why wait for the official race? They’ll quietly meet after class at Valles Marineris and settle the bet to see who’s faster. Without telling anyone – only Starling sees them go – they head off to do just that, which leads them both into some serious trouble.

<b>Election:</b> Seeing an opportunity to make some positive changes at the Academy, Eagle nominates himself as Class President... only to be challenged by Robyn, who also feels she’d make an effective leader. They agree that the only fair way to decide is to hold an election, so both candidates are soon off and running. Robyn takes a thoughtful approach, analyzing what the Racers can realistically hope to change, while Eagle makes brash, absurd promises – but coasts to victory based on his popularity. Problem is, now he finds he has to actually deliver on his crazy campaign pledges – including putting a second Moon in orbit around the Earth, which leads to a near-catastrophe in space when the new “Moon” adversely affects the gravitational pull on Earth’s ocean tides.</td></tr>

Using the minimal clues she’s able to provide, the other Racers have to methodically search every single cave on the pockmarked moon to find Starling and rescue her. Will they be able to find her before their own engines freeze shut?</td></tr>

When Raven discovers a new comet that’s passing by, Coot suggests collecting a rock sample to learn more about it. Raven, without asking permission, “borrows” Coot’s harpoon and shoots it onto the comet in order to collect the sample.

When they finally get back to the garden, they’re shocked to discover the vegetation drooping and wilting miserably. What went wrong?? The cadets launch an urgent investigation to figure out why the plants are failing, and to try to rescue them before Crane can see.

Eagle blames Raven, Raven blames Eagle; even Robyn and Hawk have their own opinions. As they quarrel, we flash back and learn how they got into this mess: the Racers are on a class trip to Venus not far from a creepy old abandoned space station, rumored to be haunted, in orbit of the planet. In a test of bravado, the kids screw up their courage to enter the dark, scary space station. What happens next becomes a matter of opinion and point-of-view: which of them accidentally set events in motion that caused the space station to re-enter Venus’s atmosphere and break up?

Trying to help the headmaster, the Racers travel to different locations on Earth and the Moon, develop hypotheses about sunrises, and finally discover that the direction of the sunrise depends upon the rotation of a planet. So they fly to Venus -- which rotates clockwise -- but since they’re not able to land there, cannot confirm their hypothesis.

Eagle, Robyn and Hawk offer to train Starling for the test, which Vulture will then have to administer.

Crane slyly asks them, while they’re there, to please observe and note any small differences between Titan and Earth. Once they reach Titan, they realize that while there are a few similarities, the two places are vastly different! Liquid methane lakes, lava ice, a 16-Earth-day night, thicker atmosphere, freezing cold temperatures and lower gravity all make for an interesting science project… but an incredibly uncomfortable and stinky camping experience.</td></tr>

<b>Paint Your Rocket:</b> During a race across Saturn's moon Titan, a cryovolcano blast strips Hawk of his colors. Eager to look like himself again, he goes in for a paint job, but a robotic error causes the cadet to emerge with a new, shockingly colorful body. He soon finds himself idolized by young groupies who follow his every move, turning him into the campus 'rock star.' To Eagle and Robyn's dismay, their friend has become ruled by his newfound fame. Inspired by Hawk's new status, Crow flies to Titan and quickly finds himself in danger. When the older cadets soar to the rescue, Hawk acts on his instincts to rescue Crow from an icy blast, accidentally stripping his paint off again. Now deemed a hero for his actions, Hawk realizes that he prefers to be guided by what really counts: what's inside. He schedules a new paint job and to everyone's relief, emerges looking like his old self.</td></tr>

<p><b>Cadet Dodo:</b> When Vulture fires Dodo, the forlorn assistant doesn't know what he'll do or where he'll go. Wanting to help, the kids suggest that he enlist in Stardust Space Academy. Dodo's intrigued: he can actually do that? Headmaster Crane agrees to give him a chance, so the cadets welcome the newest Space Racer to their team: Cadet Dodo. On a group mission with Eagle, Robyn and Hawk to Saturn's moon Io, Dodo makes an accidental discovery: a previously uncharted (and very smelly) sulfur lake. Back on Earth, Vulture gets wind of the find. Wanting the glory for himself, he quickly rehires his former sidekick and, on a wing-shake of newfound trust, they're reunited. Space explorers are granted the honor of naming their discoveries... so Dodo cheerfully names his Vulture Lake... which, to Vulture's chagrin, turns out to be the stinkiest lake in the solar system!

<b>Great Balls of Fuel:</b> The cadets and teachers journey to far-off Deep Space Station Gagarin for a closer viewing of the vast Kuiper Belt, hosted by their old friend, Russian rocket scientist Trogon. When Eagle and Raven sneak away for a game of space tag - zipping through the tubes and corridors of the station - they unwittingly tear a hole in the main fuel storage tank... causing fuel to leak out into zero gravity. Pretty soon everyone is puzzled to see fluid spheres floating by all around them. Galloping globules! A quick check on the fuel tank reveals it to now be empty - the very same fuel they'll need to get back to Earth! The spheres are too fluid and elusive to grasp, causing much slow-motion slapstick mayhem. After some frantic but unsuccessful attempts, the kids finally hit upon a solution: using straws to pierce the floating bubbles and drink the fuel out of mid-air.</td></tr>

Now about 250, he's been working up there since the school first created its Moon base. When Eagle makes a careless mistake, an angry Vulture blames the elder rocket and demands his retirement. At the big farewell party, all the cadets and teachers show up to honor him. But when a moonquake unexpectedly causes a panic, Loon's experience and relaxed demeanor save the day: unlike earthquakes, which are over quickly, he knows that moonquakes can last for up to 10 minutes. His retirement is overturned by popular demand, and the party becomes a celebration for Loon's next 100 years on the Moon!

<b>Dodo in Charge:</b> After Headmaster Crane and Sandpiper head off on vacation together, Vulture is up to his old tricks. He mounts a case before the school board to oust Crane... and replace him with Dodo. The Board agrees, and Vulture has his puppet in place. Once Dodo is in charge, however, he believes he's REALLY in charge, and makes foolhardy decisions - like approving Eagle's misguided request for a mission to the Sun. The Sun's gravity quickly proves to be too strong, and the cadet is in danger of being pulled into the Sun's fiery mass! When everyone looks to Headmaster Dodo for what to do, he doesn't know. Crane and Sandpiper, returning from vacation, happen upon Eagle - and just manage to rescue him. Vulture's plot is uncovered, Dodo is ousted, and the Board reinstates Crane.</td></tr>

<p><b>To Tell the Truth:</b> Scanning space through a telescope, Robyn spots a new asteroid but can't determine its size. Observing from a distance can play tricks with the truth: faraway objects may look small but can approach us quickly, and objects closer to Earth can seem larger but might still take a while to reach us. When Raven and Crow are sent into space to measure the asteroid, Eagle, hurt at being passed over for the mission, boasts that he's glad he's not going because he and Hawk would miss the big Cosmic Birds concert. Trouble is, they don't have tickets - and the event is all sold out. Caught in their lie, the two friends are teased at school the next day, and turn on each other - becoming so honest that it's hurtful. But they must put their squabble aside and work together to save Raven when his hubris gets him in trouble with the asteroid. In the end everyone learns a lesson about honesty, and what constitutes the truth.

Coot is overjoyed: the kids have discovered life on Mars!! As a reward, they're given the honor of being first to study the new life form in Coot's laboratory. But the more they analyze it, the more Robyn is puzzled. This bacteria looks so familiar... what is it?? They soon determine that the rock was contaminated by a sneeze from Hawk, who has a cold. Meanwhile, Coot has excitedly been telling everyone about the discovery!

The older cadets have been helping her practice, but the day before the big test she's nervous. To calm her, Robyn mentions that a comet should be visible as it passes Earth that night - and it's good luck to make a wish on it. But the comet never shows. Turns out Robyn got the dates mixed up: the comet won't appear for another four months. Starling is crestfallen, and now convinced that she'll fail. But there's still a way to see a comet that night... just not from Earth! Eagle leads the way as they race through space, dodging meteorites and other obstacles that Starling has learned to navigate. They finally see Halley's Comet, and Starling gets to make her wish after all. When Headmaster Crane learns of her brave skills on their trip, he decides that she's already passed the flight test!

Feeling her pain, Headmaster Crane assigns her an important task: to study space through the Observatory telescope and report any unusual activity. The excited junior cadet embraces her new job, reporting sightings of aliens, weird stars and other imaginary incidents, all fueled by her obsession with My Lunar Pony, her favorite TV show. So when Starling finally spots something truly amiss - Fuel Station Alpha's tools floating loose in space, thanks to Raven's carelessness - no one believes her.

<b>Goodbye:</b> A faint radio signal is picked up in Stardust Bay... coming from the direction of the Sun. Flying off to investigate, Eagle, Robyn and Raven trace the signal to Mercury instead. It seems to be coming from MESSENGER, a spacecraft that was sent to explore Mercury ages ago - but everyone had long presumed the probe to be destroyed. Is it still functioning? The racers carefully touch down on Mercury's shaded side - a tricky feat thanks to its proximity to the Sun during its broadly elliptical orbit. When they finally find MESSENGER, what's left of him is very weak, and there's nothing they can do to help. But MESSENGER says he's okay about that, and asks them to bring his final images and research back to Earth while he lives out his days on Mercury.

Every year they gather to watch the Sun set on the shortest day, and then celebrate all night - the longest night of the year. But Vulture finds this disturbing: the festivities cause Stardust Bay to lose productivity. Hoping to sabotage the holiday, he sends a team of cadets into space to adjust some satellites, but doesn't reveal his true purpose - to reflect sunlight back to Earth. To everyone's horror, the night sky suddenly vanishes and sunlight bathes the academy. But the kids are undaunted, and continue their celebration. Vulture is stunned to realize that wonder and imagination can't be stopped. Feeling the heat, he shuts off the satellites and a glistening night sky returns. A super Solstice to all - and to all a long night!

Now she can fly, race around, and eat in the cafeteria with Eagle and friends. She's like a young child, learning everything by trial and error... but once she joins her first Orb-O game, it turns out that AVA is incredibly clumsy. The cadets don't know what to do. Luckily, just as they're about to confront her, AVA admits she's been having similar doubts. Having a body isn't all it's cracked up to be, and she misses her old incorporeal self.

So Hawk races off at intermission to borrow a rock from Eagle's private collection - a rock that looks just like the Captain. Only Eagle's not there... and time is running out... so Hawk hastily borrows it without permission. While taking his bows after the show, he accidentally drops Eagle's rock and it breaks. What to do now? Going against Robyn's advice, Hawk resolves to replace the broken rock without telling Eagle about it. En route for the asteroid belt, he's taken aback when Eagle suddenly appears and wants to fly there with him!

<b>Remember the Past, Discover the Future:</b> Stardust Bay's annual "All-Star Weekend" is a few days away, and most of the kids can't wait to meet some of the academy's famed former cadets. Raven, however, seems unusually quiet. When Headmaster Crane shows them a tribute video that highlights the flying skills of legendary cadet/racer Falcon Fairflight, Raven quietly slips away. What's gotten into him? Turns out he's trying to master Falcon's signature move, the near-impossible "triple corkscrew," but failing miserably. Crane finds Raven alone, wistfully rewatching the video... and wishing he could be more like Falcon, whom we learn was his late father. It's not what Falcon was able to do in the air, Crane explains, it's what he had inside: heart and determination. Raven ultimately finds a way to prove to himself - and to his friends - that he's made of the same strong fiber as his celebrated dad.</td></tr>

<p><b>New Cadet on the Block:</b> Everyone is abuzz about a cool new kid who transferred to the academy. Kite's reputation as a daredevil and amazing Orb-O player precedes him, and no one can wait - especially Eagle and Raven, who look forward to the competition. On the day the new cadet arrives, Coot unveils the Observatory's powerful new telescope... which Crow thinks is the coolest thing ever, eagerly learning all about what it can do. Kite quickly lives up to his legend, showing off his athletic prowess and cool demeanor. But he's also a relentless comedian - and seems to have picked Crow for the butt of his jokes. As the bullying escalates and Crow grows more withdrawn, even shying away from the telescope, the other kids decide that enough is enough. Eventually they help Kite understand that no one's laughing anymore, and that an attitude adjustment and apologies are in order.

<b>Dream Big:</b> Gosling's parents are both freighters, and he's destined to continue in the family business. But the young rocket harbors a keen interest in science and secretly yearns to be a Stardust Space Academy cadet. When Coot catches him listening in on a class, he invites Gosling to join them. Raven is dismissive: what does a freighter know about science and space? But Eagle and the others are more inclusive, and find that they can actually learn a thing or two from this bright, R 10 inquisitive kid. When Raven's reckless bravado gets him stranded in space without enough fuel, it's Gosling who calculates just how much fuel they'll both need to return home, and comes to his rescue. In the end, the school welcomes one of its most promising new students: Cadet Gosling!</td></tr>

<p><b>It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Galaxy:</b> The cadets are helping Coach Pigeon polish old Fuel Station Alpha, when Crow accidentally activates a view screen. It's a taped message from Fizzy Finchfuzz, owner of the Fizzy Fuel Pop Company, announcing a big race called The Gravity Slingshot Run. The rules are simple: whoever can slingshot from the orbit of one planet to the next - passing every planet in the solar system, using as little fuel as possible - and return to the station first will win the grand prize: 350,000 bottles of Fizzy Fuel Pop! The greedy kids take off in pairs, while Pigeon follows them to make sure they stay safe and to verify who the winners are. The race turns into a weeks-long, insane scramble through the solar system, with each team encountering one obstacle after another. It's a tie at the finish line, where the kids find out just how OLD Fizzy's taped message was: when they finally taste the fuel pop, it's all stale and flat! Yuchh!

<b>That'll Teach You:</b> Eagle, Hawk and Raven resent doing ,all the hard work, around the school while the teachers seemingly have it easy. Robyn's not so sure about that... but she can't stop Eagle and gang from complaining to Headmaster Crane. Amused by their protests, he offers a proposal: each of them can take the place of an adult for one day, and judge for themselves. Eagle quickly agrees to replace Crane, while Hawk will take Coot's place and Raven will do Coach Pigeon's job. It isn't long before they realize that appearances can be deceiving, as each cadet struggles to fill the wheels of their older and more experienced counterparts. Okay, they admit it: the life of an adult rocket is just as hard as the life of a cadet. Once they've come to terms with that, it's time to do some damage control...</td></tr>

<p><b>Double-O Dodo:</b> Vulture loudly fires Dodo again, and Headmaster Crane takes pity and hires him as an assistant. But when Dodo is caught trying to steal the plans for a new engine that Coot is working on for an upcoming competition, Crane realizes that the firing was a charade: Dodo was sent as a spy! Instead of turning him in, however, Crane decides to turn Dodo into a double-spy, sending him back to Vulture with fake plans. The new mission: to bring back the design plans that Vulture's team is working on. But Vulture quickly catches on too, and flips Dodo again, returning him to Crane as a triple spy. The silly Spy vs. Spy espionage continues to escalate, finally coming to a head at the big technology competition where Crane and Vulture square off - and conclude that by working together, they can better solve the design problems both sides were experiencing.

<b>First Do No Harm:</b> Pluto has been demoted and reclassified as a dwarf planet, but Vulture has big plans for it: "Vulture World," a grand amusement park filled with Vulture-themed rides and attractions. But first they'll need to terraform Pluto and make it more like Earth up there, by adding heat, water, oxygen and dirt. He dispatches Eagle, Robyn, Hawk and Raven to travel there and get to work on it. All is going as planned... until they hit an unexpected obstacle: the discovery of water! The #1 rule of space exploration: If there's any chance of life developing on a planet, or even a dwarf planet, they must leave it alone and return to Earth. Vulture is furious, and not to be denied. So he and Dodo fly to Pluto themselves to continue the cadets' work. But when Dodo accidentally terraforms Vulture's head, causing a flower to sprout there, all activity must cease - for good this time. Aaargh!!</td></tr>

<p><b>Stardust Rhythm:</b> Robyn and Hawk are excited about the school's Poetry Slam Festival that's coming up soon. And when Eagle learns that there's a grand prize for the winner of the best poem - a cool new space helmet - even he is suddenly into it. The kids begin writing about their favorite subjects; Eagle is all about speed, and Hawk writes about strength, but Robyn suffers a crisis of confidence when she tries to rhapsodize about science and math. Is that cool enough? Meanwhile, Vulture overhears a bit of Sandpiper's poem about the purple skies of Titan, and mistakenly believes that she's interested in him romantically - so he prepares to recite an ode to their mutual love. It all sets the table for an unexpectedly lively festival when the big day arrives, hosted by Poetry Slam Master Crane.

<b>M Is For Meteorite:</b> While Robyn interviews Headmaster Crane for a blog story about how science is essentially mystery-solving using evidence and deduction, Coot rushes into the Zen Garden with news that a meteorite has landed somewhere on campus! He doesn't know exactly where, but his detection machines have never been wrong. An excited Robyn wants to find the meteorite, and she enlists Eagle, Hawk and Raven to help. Clues lead them on a path all over school grounds - even underwater, into the bay - till they finally deduce that the rock ricocheted off the Spacenasium's lightning rod... but then the clues run dry. Discouraged, Robyn decides to catch up on other projects, including her blog entry. Which is when she notices something in a picture she took of Crane earlier that day... a rock that wasn't there before, now jutting up from his reflection pond. Could it be...?!</td></tr>

<p><b>When the Envy Bug Bites:</b> Raven is envious of Eagle's cool new landing lights, and wants a new array for himself. Headmaster Crane warns him about the dangers of envy, urging him to be content with what he has. But Raven wants what he wants, so when Vulture lures him to his Starflight Emporium &amp; Trading Post, the cadet trades away his old tow-line plus some work IOUs for a brand new lighting array. Still envious of other friends' possessions, he continues to trade in again and again for newer, bigger and better gizmos and gadgets... getting deeper and deeper into IOU work debt to Vulture... finally ending up with his old tow-line again. But when Starling gets into trouble on the moon and needs Raven's help, he discovers that the tow-line turns out to be more valuable than any new gadgets he'd coveted.

<p><b>Ships in a Bottle:</b> In this <a href="/wiki/Clip_show" title="Clip show">clip show</a>, while Eagle and Hawk lug crates of empty Fizzy Fuel Pop bottles down to the recycling center in the basement, they chat animatedly about the big upcoming return performance by the Rooster Rockets. In his excitement, Hawk executes a whirly Rooster move, igniting his afterburner - which accidentally seals the metal door shut. Despite their best efforts the door won't budge, and no one's receiving their radio signals from the deep underground room. And there's no other way out! Hoping someone will realize they're missing and come looking for them, they reminisce about other goofs and blunders from the past, which we see in flashback. Eventually Eagle and Hawk realize they need to save themselves... so they try to tap on an exhaust vent until Coot hears it up above. Rescued!

Once aboard the station, QUESTY is overjoyed to hear AVA's voice again! While Hawk naps, the two computer programs chatter away and catch up on all the latest gossip. But when a bubble of hot plasma erupts off the Sun and sprays solar particles into space, they wash over the station and trigger a weird technical anomaly: R 14 both AVA and QUESTY are somehow merged together inside Hawk's head. At first he tries to make the best of it... but their endless yammering keeps him awake at night, distracts him at work and play, and generally drives poor Hawk crazy. Finally he just can't take it anymore, and regretfully enlists Coot's help to separate the two programs from his aching brain.

<b>Hawk the Genius:</b> Hawk makes a series of simple predictions on Earth and in space - all guesses - that happen to come true, astonishing his friends. Even he is amazed at his own newfound powers. Eagle and the other kids hail Hawk as a super genius, and begin soliciting him for advice. Robyn has her doubts, however: you have to make careful observations and study all the available information, you can't just guess! But it's too late, the praise has already gone to Hawk's head. When Crow and Sparrow go missing on Mars, Headmaster Crane sends Eagle, Robyn and Hawk there to find them - and Hawk's luck finally runs out, getting the cadets in trouble with an unexpected Martian dust storm. In the end it takes some intense analysis, led by Robyn, to navigate their way out of the jam.</td></tr>

As things get under way, Raven and Robyn quickly get on each other's nerves. Eagle and Hawk, concerned for their friends' state of mind, decide to secretly stake-out the unhappy pair and to intervene if needed.
